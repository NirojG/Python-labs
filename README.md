## 🛠 Project Structure
The lab is organized into specialized modules:

- algorithms: Efficient implementations of data structures and logic.
- design_patterns: Practical examples of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns (e.g., Factory, Observer, Singleton).
- concurrency: High-performance code using asyncio, threading, and multiprocessing.
- api_design: Clean RESTful patterns using frameworks like FastAPI or Flask.
